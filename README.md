JavaScript Applications (JS Apps) develops practical skills for building front-end applications with JavaScript, jQuery, ReactJS, AJAX and REST services. The course is based on state-of-the-art standards and JS technologies (ES2017 is used).

Studying HTTP, REST and jQuery AJAX and accessing REST services with AJAX queries. JavaScript and REST-based client applications are built to retrieve and visualize data from public REST APIs such as GitHub API, TheMovieDb API, and CRUD through REST authentication service. Consideration is also being given to building backend REST services on cloud-based backend-as-a-service / BaaS.

The principles of asynchronous JavaScript programming with promises, async / await and Web workers, as well as Web storage (cookies, session and local storage) and the use of help libraries, tools and technologies such as Babel transpiler, Grunt and Gulp, ESLint , lodash, sammy, and others.

UI and templating data visualization use ReactJS technology, which provides a modern model for building responsive, reusable JavaScript UI components by combining HTML and JavaScript.

The technologies studied in the course combine to build a single-page application based on MVC architecture (model-view-controller) with ReactJS for the UI part, Sammy.js (for routing and events) and jQuery AJAX to call REST services from an existing REST API).
